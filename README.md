# Hotel_Booking_Prediction

The project aims to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled based on various features, including spatial information and numerical data. The model will be developed using  machine learning classification algorithms such as logistic regression and other classification techniques.

Following techniques were used to implement
-Data Collection and Preprocessing
-Feature Engineering
-Exploratory Data Analysis
-Modeling and Prediction(Logistic Regression,Decision Trees,Random                   
   Forest,Naives Bayes and KNN)
   
 Tools used
-Programming Languages- Python (with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciKit-Learn,)
-Visualization Tools-Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for data visualization.
